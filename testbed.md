The NDN testbed is a shared community resource that enables global, wide-area NDN research. Each participating member of the testbed commits a local server to act as a managed NDN gateway node. The NDN testbed directly supports the research community by enabling any researcher in the world to connect to the testbed and develop, evaluate, and operate NDN-based applications and services over a global footprint. All of these nodes are centrally managed by the co-PI Crowley and his Washington University team.

As of January 2015, the testbed consists of 30 nodes with a healthy distribution. Nine of the gateway nodes are at NDN project sites in the US; 21 gateway nodes are at collaborating institutions, among which 13 of the nodes are in the US, 8 are in Asia, and 9 are in Europe. The testbed has been an instrumental resource in conducting NDN research and staging wide-area experiments and demonstrations.
